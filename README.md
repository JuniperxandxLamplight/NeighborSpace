## Brainstorm

#### Thought Process
  _I want to look at other websites for other companies like this, but also sites for smaller less corporate sites of different kinds for inspiration on themes and color schemes._

#### Researched Sites

Company Site | What I Liked | What I Didn't
------------- | ----- | ------
WeWork | Clean design, Smooth media queries, Lots of info throughout | Too much white, Boring design, Lots of click throughs
TechSpace | Visually interesting, Consistent color scheme | Specific info pages kind of bare, Poor visual hierarchy
Case Study | More intimate/niche feeling, Unique visual style | Limited info, Empty looking pages

#### Ideas
* _Amenities in a prominent position_
* _Limited color scheme, warm and graphic (tan, light pink, and sky blue maybe?)_
* _Unique Features given more visual space and weight_
* _Very obvious layout for clients not in the tech field/tech-illiterate_
* _Community features?_
* _Profile/login pages_
